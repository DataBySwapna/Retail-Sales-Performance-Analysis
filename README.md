# Categorization and Data Summary 📊
This step categorizes products based on sales volume and summarizes the data using a pivot table.
- **SWITCH Function**:  
  - Example Formula: `=SWITCH(TRUE, [Sales Volume]>=600, "High", [Sales Volume]>=300, "Medium", "Low")`.
- **Pivot Table**:
  - Summarized data by county (rows) and product types (columns).
  - Sales Volume used as the aggregated value.
